                <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                <p>Explore the Cloud Optimized GeoTiff (COG) format, and how it works within AGOL or similar for photo access.</p>
                <h2>What is Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF?</h2>
                <p>Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (or COG) is an image format optimized for use in the web.
                    It is a modified form of GeoTIFF, which is just a Georeferenced TIFF, which
                    stands for Tagged Image Format. Regular images on the web load vertically,
                    line-by-line, and in their entirety. COG are able to load in tiles, small squares
                    at a time, and can stop loading when they exit the viewing area. This should allow for 
                    faster loading and much less bandwidth consumption. Additionally, they can store
                    multiple versions of an image at different zoom levels called 'overviews', which
                    can also cause the image to load faster. This is because the overivew can be sent
                    to the browser instead of the entire image, which would then have to be rendered
                    in place to represent any pixels that can't be individually loaded.
                </p>
                <h2>What is AGOL?</h2>
                <p>AGOL, or ArcGIS Online, is a mapping solution created by Esri. It was originally
                    considered for this project for its known capabilities and convenience, however
                    it eventually set aside due to budgetary constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>What is Leaflet?</h2>
                <p>Leaflet is a lightweight, open-source javascript mapping library. It is fast, easy
                    to use and learn, and very capable. It is also free-to-use and open source, with
                    a lot of community support and 3rd-party extensions that can be used. After reviewing
                    several options, it was selected as the web mapping library of choice for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>What is our process?</h2>
                <p>We used GDAL to convert a GeoTIFF to COG. For exploration purposes, we attempted it in
                    both ArcGIS Pro and QGIS. We also developed a basic Leaflet application, and attempted
                    to get a few different image formats to load - COG, GeoTIFF, and a regular PNG.
